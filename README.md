# Current Issues
* Dashboard does nothing 
* Search is not implemented at all
* New accounts are not sorted alphabetically 
* On the account edit page, you cannot update account details such as name address etc, 
* The header says john doe for all accounts 
* I can’t edit check amounts 
* the “pay check” button does nothing
* letters does not work
* no ability to add an extra check to an account (the routing number is currently hidden, therefore can't see the account name)
